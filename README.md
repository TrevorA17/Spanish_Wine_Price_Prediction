# Spanish Wine Price Prediction
Welcome to my Wine Type Prediction Project! This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the type of wine based on various features such as winery, wine name, rating, number of reviews, region, body, acidity, and price. I have trained a decision tree model using a dataset containing information about different wines. The model has been saved and deployed as a Plumber API endpoint, allowing users to make predictions on new data via HTTP requests. Whether you're a wine enthusiast, retailer, or researcher, my API provides a convenient way to classify wines and enhance decision-making processes. Feel free to explore the API and integrate it into your applications or workflows!
